C     Due to the number of COSMO charges that may be generated the
C     use of a geometry instance to hold the charges is deprecated. 
C     It is much more sensible to replace this geometry instance with a
C     Bq instance which is "unlimited" in size. The Bq instances, however,
C     have no mechanism to store the invnuc quantities that we need for
C     the 1-electron integrals in the presence of ECPs. So we abuse another
C     Bq instance to store that stuff.
