  The RTDB is a simple data base that stores typed, binary data
using simple character string names.
  
  E.g.,
     
       To store an array of N integers with the name 'counts'

       call rtdb_put(rtdb, 'counts', MT_INT, N, count_array)


  The MA type definitions are used to support typing of data.

  Fortran applications need to include

           rtdb.fh

  C applications need to include


           rtdb.h

  Routines are provided for sequential and parallel access.

  a) Sequential access

     Only process 0 can do this.  If any other process trys, an
     error will result


  b) Parallel access

     All operations are globally synchronous.  Process 0 performs
     all necessary operations and broadcasts results to other
     processes.  Source for names and data for writes to the 
     data base come from the arguments of process 0.

     Parallel routines are named similarly to sequential routines
     by using rtdb_par_ instead of just rtdb_

     Once opened using rtdb_par_open() the RTDB may be used in parallel
     by all processes through rtdb_par_*() or just by process 0
     using rtdb_*().


  The C interface is documented in the file rtdb.h

  The Fortran interface is documented in the file rtdb.fh
