# The subdirectories of tools come from a separate repository, and the
# presence of the CVS directory here will make cvs look at only the
# files here from the NWChem repository and not recurse.  So to do cvs
# operations on the subdirectories, we temporarily move CVS away, and
# move it back when we're done.  Trapping interrupts means that we
# should always be leaving things in a consistent state even if the
# user interrupts the cvs command.
