This is a converted version of the scf test code in the tcgmsg directory
that solves the Hartree-Fock equations for a cluster of beryllium atoms.
The main modifications are that this code is uses distributed data
instead of replicated data and is based on the GA function calls instead
of TCGMSG. The input is a simple XYZ format file of the form

1 Number of beryllium atoms
2 Blank line
3 4 x y z
4 4 x y z
.
.
.

Other parameters that control convergence etc. can be found in the cscf.h
file. The two-electron Fock build does not make use of the 8-fold symmetry
of the two-electron integrals. The default diagonalization routine makes
use of a similarity transform so that only a standard eigenvalue problem
needs to be solved. A direct solution using a generalized eigenvalue solver
can be had by setting the USE_TRANSFORM compiler directive to 0 in the top
of the scf.F file.

A larger system containing 16 atoms has also been included in this
directory. To run the larger problem, just copy the file be16.inpt to
be.inpt and run the code.

(2). remove all .F files after checking out from SVN

(3). change the path for GA in the Makefile

(4). use the command "module load pgi/10.6" to load pgcc
     use the command "module load mpi/mvapich/1.1/pgi" to load mpi

(5). You can compile your GA in Trinity by "gmake TARGET=LINUX64 USE_MPI=y ARMCI_NETWORK=OPENIB CC=pgcc FC=pgf90 LIBMPI="-lmpich -libumad" 2>&1 | tee make.log"
