c
c     Common for parameters to do with convergence and common details
c     of the NR/PCG UHF, ROHF SCF, and RI-SCF
c
c     These are determined by scf_get_info from input/default
c
c
c     oinitialized  = true if initialized
c     gnorm_tol  = convergence threshold for gradient norm
c     shifts(6)  = level shifts
c     nr_gswitch = value of max. element of gradient at which to
c                 enable NR
c     tol2e      = 2-e integral selection threshold for energy/gradient
c     maxiter    = maximum no. of iterations
c
c     geom       = Geometry handle
c     basis      = Basis handle
c     trans      = Translated basis set name
c     title      = Job title

c     nelec      = no. of electrons
c     nbf        = no. of basis functions
c     nmo        = no. of linearly indep. MOs (= nbf for now)
c     nalpha     = no. of alpha spin electrons for UHF only
c     nbeta      = no. of beta spin electrons for UHF only
c
c     l/k_eval   = scf eigen values (local ma handle)
c     l/k_occ    = scf occupation (local ma handle)
c     l/k_irs    = MO symmetries (2*nmo for UHF)
c     g_movecs   = eigen-vectors  (global ga handle) (2x array for UHF)
c
c     oskel      = if true use symmetry in fock building
c     oadapt     = if true force symmetry on the MOs
c     ouser_changed_conv  if true the user overrode default conv. parms.
c     olock      = if true use max overlap to lock orbitals to correspond
c                  to input orbitals.  Has side effect of disabling
c                  some convergence aids (interim diag of fock matrix)
c
c     olagr      = if true lagrangian is stored in a file
c                  needed for open shell ROHF gradients
c
c     These are determined by rohf_precond_select and control convergence.
c
c     ls_tol      = conv. threshold for line search 
c     lshift      = current level shift for preconditioner
c     precond_tol = accuracy required for preconditioner
c     oconjugacy  = if (false) PCG must reset conjugacy condition
c     ododiag     = diagonalize the next fock matrix
c     odisable_nr = if true turns NR off (i.e. pflg=1) for ever
c     pflg_prev   = previous setting for pflg (1=1-e hessian, 2=exact)
c     pflg        = current setting for pflg
c     eprec       = estimated precision in energy for line search
c
c     These are determined by rohf_nr_solve
c
c     iter = current macro iteration number
c
c     for RI-SCF
c
c     nriscf      = 1: RI hessian
c                 = 2: pure RI-SCF
c                 = 3: reconverge without RI after RI_SCF convergence
c     riscf_basis = basis set handle for expansion basis
