c
c     this common contains full one particle coupling coefficients
c     <*|eij|*> for the largest no. of open shells that 
c     have root for <= 8 shells triplet
c
c     these next three parameters are used to dimension the
c     arrays in common ... they are derived from 8 electrons triplet
c
c     nsc    = max # open shells can hold info for
c     nfc    = max # functions for this many open shells (triplet)
c     nfc2   = no. functions for nsc-2 open shells
c     
c     nseij  = no. of open shells for which info is stored
c     ns4eij = no. of open shells handled for case4
c              this may be smaller than nseij if nseij=nsmax as
c              to compute case 4 involves using w2 for ns4eij+2

c                         LHS configuration. ib and jb label the
