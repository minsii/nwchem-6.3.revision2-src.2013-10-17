1. change the environment variables in env_nwchem.source
   and source the file
   # set the environment variable LIBMPI if your mpi library is not '-lmpi'

2. make sure that the cca tools are compiled

3. compile the cca-chem-generic code
   If you have access to the cca-forum repository you can get the code by:
    setenv CVSROOT :ext:vidhya@cca-forum.org:/cvs/cca-chem
    setenv CVS_RSH ssh
    cvs co cca-chem-generic

4. compile NWChem: 
   This should generally just be two commands if you did step 1:
   In the $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src directory
   "make nwchem_config"
   "make >& make.log &"

5. make sure that the stubs file is available
   In the $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src directory
   "make stubs.o"
   
6. build cca component in the $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/cca directory:
   change config.txt if necessary and source it or do your own configure
   make
   make install

7. test cca component
   cd $(NWCHEM_TOP)/src/cca/tests
   modify CCAFERC file
   ccafe-single --ccafe-rc CCAFERC
