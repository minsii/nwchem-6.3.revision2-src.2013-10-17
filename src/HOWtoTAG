Several people have asked me how to move new directories or files
from the development tree to the release tree.  Here's how

Directories have no version information associated with them; only the
files in directories are under control.   So, once you have added
and commited your directory to the development tree as usual,
all that you need to do to propagate this to the release tree is
to insert the tag and branch information.  Still in your checked
out DVELOPMENT version

   cvs tag release-3-2-1 newdir
   cvs tag -r release-3-2-1 -b release-3-2-1-patches newdir

The repository has been modifed to include the tag and branch info
but your copy of the files are STILL the development branch.

To check out the release branch you need to follow the instructions
frommy previous email.  Go into your release tree and

  cvs update -d -r release-3-2-1-patches newdir

You can verify the state of all files in the newdir by

  cvs status newdir

This will print out the version and sticky tag info for each file 
in newdir.  If you have the release tree you should ssee sticky tags
of release-3-2-1-patches, but in the development tree it should say
none.

Simple, isn't it.
