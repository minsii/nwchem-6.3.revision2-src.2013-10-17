testfft3 runs and times ffts from md1xmd2xmd3 to nd1xnd2xnd3
by increasing dimensions together by multiplying by 2. (These 
parameters are defined in parms.fh.) It performs a forward,
then an inverse fft, checking the infinity norm against a 
small tolerance.

Output from a normal run is attached.


to make::  1) make peigs (for comm), libpfft.a
           2) run: make test

to run::  w/parallel command) cd tst; edit testfft3.p to
                              reflect your configuration.

          otherwise) use the method on hand for mpp
